# AeroGameFramework Plugin

Install the [AeroGameFramework Plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/1882232354/AeroGameFramework-Plugin) from the Roblox website. The plugin will help organize and assist development within the framework. You can then keep it up-to-date with the Studio plugin updater.

Alternatively, you can download the AeroGameFrameworkPlugin.rbxmx file in the repository, which is the development model for the plugin. To import it into Studio, go to the Model tab, and then click on the Model button under the Advanced category.

**Note:** The plugin does _not_ install the framework, but rather serves as a helpful tool to assist with development.
